It has been seven months since I've been to GitHub. The only command I am recalling is `git init` at this point. It is currently 1300. Should be interesting to see how long it takes to create a repository and upload some code after so long. 

Recently, I've been working with C++. 
 
Reaction to last post:

Plan of action: 

* daily warm ups (I went too deep on these which took up too much time)

* work on a project I love (Check. Learning circuits and Arduinos)

* continue to submit applications (Need to work on interview skills, apparently)

* weekly collaboration with a wonderful organization called (fell away from this, but gearing up to go back within the next month)

* Take care of body (fail)

Current Project: upload this to GitHub followed by working accelerometer code.

* `git status`
* `git add`
* `git commit -m`

Well, that was fun. Like riding a bike. 


Light and Love, z
