So I tried to set up this a github blog 6 months ago. I spent days and days on it, but never got it.

Today, after 5 months of coding bootcamp, I got it working all on my own.
Incredible. 

Here are some of the sites that helped:

* [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages]
* [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll]
