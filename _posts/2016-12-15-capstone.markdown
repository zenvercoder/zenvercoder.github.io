### How I made this app in 6 days

* Found cool stuff on the internet. Put it all together in one package.

##Day 1

* Searched "Ripple" on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), found [Ripple CodePen](http://codepen.io/daless14/pen/ELFgj) by [Anthony DAlessio](http://codepen.io/daless14/)

* [Using the Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_Web_Audio_API#Creating_an_audio_context)

*  [Voice-change-O-matic](https://mdn.github.io/voice-change-o-matic/)

* [Lotus Flower](http://codepen.io/mrfarmer777/pen/RaEeBb) by [Matt Farmer](http://codepen.io/mrfarmer777/)

* Searched for "Sand" on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/), found [Landscape Circle SVG](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/pen/XNjQBR) by [Tim Rijkse](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/)

## Day 2

* Did some styling. Moved some stuff around.

* Playing with this  [Landscape Circle SVG](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/pen/XNjQBR) thing. Trying to get the bouncy circle to work. Having difficulty.

## Day 3

* Still playing with this [Landscape Circle SVG](http://codepen.io/timrijkse/pen/XNjQBR) pen. When I cut out the tress and mountains, the circle just sits there statically. Researching `TimelineMax` brought me to [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/). This is an interesting site. I look forward to playing with this.

* Update: GreenSock is a huge rabbit hole. I'm on a time crunch. Just going to use [Ripple](http://codepen.io/daless14/pen/ELFgj) for now.

* Spent half an hour freaking out. Thought I broke it. Turns out, I had my headphones plugged in and it was messing up the input. Lol. 

* Update: Filtered out Ripple so I get only one Ripple. Making the Ripple coincide with how many seconds a person ommmmmms is going to be more complicated. 

* Fixing the wave/frequency visual (wave is too sharp, frequency needs to be scootched over to the right some).

* Cool [transfergraph tool](http://kevincennis.github.io/transfergraph/) by [Kevin Ennis](http://stackoverflow.com/users/717965/kevin-ennis)

* [Visualizations with Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Visualizations_with_Web_Audio_API)

## Day 4

* Made zero progress. Well, no discernible progress anyway. I learned more about what is going on in the code and things that can break the app (I broke it more than once). However, I did cut out some fat and learned more about frequency.

## Day 5

* Feels like I made very little progress, but I'm still learning a lot and I feel like I'm allllmost there. The waves look a little better. I'm now getting a frequency readout in the console. I want to make the canvas bigger/smaller if the frequency is within human range. 

* Tried some things like `var halfIntendedWidth = intendedWidth / 2;`

* `var ctx = document.getElementById('canvas').getContext('2d');` 

* `canvas.setAttribute`

* `ctx.scale(x, y);`

## Day 6 

* scrambled. Finally got things together for the capstone

## Day something + more days melting into more days

* Wanting to do a different random animation every time a person ommms for three seconds or more. Background and canvas animating rt now. It's not pretty (yet), but almost functional.

* [Background Gradient with animated Hue](http://codepen.io/416studios/pen/zGNbxd?editors=0010) by [Michael D](http://codepen.io/416studios/)

* also found http://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/zxgzMQ and http://codepen.io/chrisgannon/pen/ZWRgza

* Needed a button, found [Button Hover States](http://codepen.io/thejamespower/pen/OVNYLL) by [James Power](http://codepen.io/thejamespower/) on [Codepen](http://codepen.io/)
