### Update

* Iteration two of site is taking more than a day after all. I whittled it down to an MVP, but as is often the case in development, things take longer than you think.

* There is way more content now, so filling in the images, links and descriptions is where I'm at right now. It's a lot of grunt work, but this time I'm using material design for layout/style, so I'm thinking I won't have to do another iteration for a while.
