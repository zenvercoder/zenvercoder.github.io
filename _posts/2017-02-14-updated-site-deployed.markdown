### Update

* Iteration two of site is taking more than a day after all. I whittled it down to an MVP, but as is often the case in development, things take longer than you think.

* There is way more content now, so filling in the images, links and descriptions is where I'm at right now. It's a lot of grunt work, but this time I'm using material design for layout/style, so I'm thinking I won't have to do another iteration for a while.

* edit: I noticed the images/gifs are working on github, but not github.io hmmm... going to try changing the path for now and if that doesn't work I'll come back to it later (so many different rabbit holes I could jump down)

* That didn't work. Going to try one more thing: [GitHub Tricks: Upload Images & Live Demos](http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/)
