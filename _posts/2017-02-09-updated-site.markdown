### Updated Website

* First iteration of zenvercoder.co took more than 3 weeks. Iteration 2 took a weekend. Iteration 3: Less than a day.

* It still has some work to do, but now more functionality and user friendly.

* Iteration 2 was not user-friendly (limited navigation). I kept the old site for a while because I was mesmerized by Parallax, however navigation was not the only issue (responsiveness and functionality were also issues). 

* [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/index.html)
