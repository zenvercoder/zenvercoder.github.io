### Intro to HTML/CSS

* Second time I helped to teach this class

* Co-teacher: [Anu Shrestha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anudle)

* The [slides](http://slides.com/zenvercoder/deck-2-12-5) we used

* The [CodePen](http://codepen.io/zenvercoder/pen/mOgLXB) we played with

* I really enjoyed this one even more than the first one because it was a smaller group and it was more of a conversation than a lecture. I think people were more engaged

* Thanks to [Josh Couper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshcouper) for the opportunity to practice/give back
