The first iteration of [zenvercoder.co] took me a month or more. I created, styled, positioned each box manually.

On the second iteration, I simply pulled from different [resources] online and slapped something together in less than a day (two if you count breaks to take care of non-coding life stuff). It helped that I have spent almost every day for the last six months buried in code. I learned some things along the way for sure. I could have done it on my own, but it still would have taken me a lot longer to calculate those parallax maths.

Learning to read other people's code and understanding how to implement/manipulate that code is just as valuable as knowing how to do it from scratch (it's just way faster).
