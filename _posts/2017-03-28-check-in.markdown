### Checking in

Graduated from Galvanize in December. 

Out of 28 classmates, only 6 or 7 of us have jobs at this point. I hear this same story all over the place, and not just for Galvanize (they did an amazing job, don't get me wrong. I probably learned in 6 months what would have taken me at least 2 or 3 years on my own). 

I haven't really taken advantage of their Alumni group which is focused on helping people apply for jobs/refine their resumes and cover letters (doing so would require putting on pants). 

I've heard horror stories of new grads who land dream jobs only to be ousted after three months because they could not keep up.

I've been applying to dev jobs and even landed a couple of in-person interviews, but mostly I don't even hear back.

Companies reach out to me for different reasons, even though I have little to no experience in their tech stack. In those cases, I research/experiment with their tech stack (ex: Ruby, React, Java, Clojure and many others).

This has resulted in a lot of defeats, frustration and a thinning of the spread.
 
Plan of action: 

* daily warm ups 

    * [JS30](https://javascript30.com/) is a good place to go for that. 
    * [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is also good, but I was too ambitious and I found myself burning off an entire work day trying to solve a single kata. 
      JS30 is light and enjoyable and I can move on after less than an hour (if I don't go too deep with customizing). 

* work on a project I love

* continue to submit applications, but not allow myself to be swayed by every whiff of prospect

* weekly collaboration with a wonderful organization called [Code for Denver](http://www.codefordenver.org/)

* Take care of body (so easy to put off)

And with that, I'm off to the World of Development.

Light and Love, z
